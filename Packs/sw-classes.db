{"name":"Dragon Disciple","permission":{"default":0,"fRudea7oGPoV9HaK":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As some of the most ancient, powerful, and capricious creatures in existence, dragons occasionally enter into trysts with unsuspecting mortals or sire offspring with exceptional individuals. Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and&mdash;at the pinnacle of their abilities&mdash;assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Role:</strong> With the magic of a spellcasting class at their disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their opponents. Dragon disciples&rsquo; draconic abilities, however, make these versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath weapons and f light to destroy their foes directly.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alignment: </strong>Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good alignments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hit Die:</strong> d12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> Any nondragon.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Draconic.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells without preparation. If the character has sorcerer levels, he must have the draconic bloodline. If the character gains levels of sorcerer after taking this class, he must take the draconic bloodline.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[{"_id":"ufbxienq","formula":"","operator":"add","target":"","subTarget":"","modifier":"","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"links":{"children":[]},"classType":"base","tag":"dragonDisciple","useCustomTag":false,"levels":{"value":0,"_deprecated":true},"level":1,"hd":8,"hp":8,"bab":"low","skillsPerLevel":0,"savingThrows":{"fort":{"value":"high"},"ref":{"value":"low"},"will":{"value":"high"}},"fc":{"hp":{"value":12},"skill":{"value":2},"alt":{"value":0}},"classSkills":{"acr":false,"apr":false,"art":false,"blf":false,"clm":false,"crf":false,"dip":true,"dev":false,"dis":false,"esc":true,"fly":true,"han":false,"hea":false,"int":false,"kar":true,"kdu":true,"ken":true,"kge":true,"khi":true,"klo":true,"kna":true,"kno":true,"kpl":true,"kre":true,"lin":false,"lor":false,"per":true,"prf":false,"pro":false,"rid":false,"sen":false,"slt":false,"spl":true,"ste":false,"sur":false,"swm":false,"umd":false},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{},"effects":[],"_id":"iqZdV6O8DSjT6qfI"}
