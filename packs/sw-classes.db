{"name":"Spellslinger","permission":{"default":0,"fRudea7oGPoV9HaK":3},"type":"class","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Spellslinger (Wizard Archtype)</strong></p>\n<p>While few contest the seductive allure of commanding arcane and occult powers, there are those wizards who become obsessed with the natural mysteries of black powder. Combining this emerging technology with their considerable arcane skills, they transform firearms into a powerful focus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Gun (Su): </strong>The spellslinger gains the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat, and one or two of his firearms can be arcane guns. Arcane guns are normal onehanded or two-handed firearms in the hands of others, as they were normal firearms before the spellslinger imbued them with magic. In a spellslinger&rsquo;s hands, they both fire projectiles (bullets and pellets) and cast magic. At 1st level, the spellslinger decides whether he wants to have one or two arcane guns at a time. If the spellslinger chooses to have only one arcane gun at a time, spells fired through the arcane gun that require an attack roll have a &times;3 critical hit multiplier.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spellslinger can cast any ranged touch attack, cone, line, or ray spells through his arcane gun. When he casts through the arcane gun, the gun&rsquo;s enhancement bonus (if any) is a bonus to the spell&rsquo;s attack rolls or to the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DCs. Yet there are dangers inherent to this method. If any of the spells&rsquo; attack rolls result in a natural 1 (a misfire), or a natural 20 is rolled on any saving throw made against the spell by a target (an overload), the arcane gun gains the broken condition. If the arcane gun already has the broken condition, the gun explodes. When a gun explodes, it lets loose a blast of force, or if the spell has the acid, cold, electricity, or sonic descriptor, it deals that type of energy damage instead. In the case of spells with multiple descriptors, roll randomly among the descriptors to determine the type of damage dealt by the blast. The blast is centered on a single intersection within the spellslinger&rsquo;s space (spellslinger&rsquo;s choice) and deals 1d6 points of the appropriate energy damage or force damage per level of the spell cast. Any creature within the blast other than the spellslinger can make a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. The Reflex save DC is calculated using the spell level of the spell being sacrificed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spellslinger can attune his arcane guns at the start of each day. That attunement lasts until the spellslinger attunes to a new gun, even if a formally attuned gun is destroyed. <strong>This ability replaces arcane bond.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Gunsmith:</strong> The spellslinger gains the Gunsmithing feat (see page 103) and a battered gun that is identical to the gun a gunslinger (see page 9) gains at first level. If the spellslinger chooses the ability to attune two arcane guns, he still only starts out with one gun. Like a gunslinger, a spellslinger can use the Gunsmithing feat to restore his battered gun. <strong>This ability replaces scribe scroll.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mage Bullets (Su):</strong> A spellslinger is adept at transferring spell energy into his arcane gun attacks. As a swift action, he can sacrifice a spell and transform that energy into a weapon bonus equal to the level of the spell sacrificed on a single barrel of his firearm. With that weapon bonus the spellslinger can apply any of the following to his arcane bond: enhancement bonuses (up to +5) and dancing, defending, distance, flaming, flaming burst, frost, ghost touch, icy burst, merciful, seeking, shock, shocking burst, spell storing, thundering, vicious, and wounding. An arcane gun gains no benefit from having two of the same weapon special abilities on the same barrel. The effect of the mage bullets ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, or until this ability is used again to assign the barrel different enhancements. <strong>This ability replaces cantrips</strong>, but the spellslinger gains the detect magic and read magic cantrips and places them in his spellbook. He can cast either of these as 1st-level spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>School of the Gun:</strong> The rigor and care required by arcane guns is so great that a spellslinger forsakes four schools of magic. These opposition schools are chosen at 1st level and cannot be changed later. A spellslinger who prepares a spell from his opposition school must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. In addition, the spellslinger takes a &ndash;4 penalty on any skill checks made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. <strong>This ability replaces arcane school.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wizard Archtype:</p>\n<p>Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. The works of beings beyond mortals, the legends of realms where gods and spirits tread, the lore of creations both wondrous and terrible&mdash;such mysteries call to those with the ambition and the intellect to rise above the common folk to grasp true might. Such is the path of the wizard. These shrewd magic-users seek, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge, drawing on cultic arts to work wonders beyond the abilities of mere mortals. While some might choose a particular field of magical study and become masters of such powers, others embrace versatility, reveling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning and potent lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.</p>\n<p>Role: While universalist wizards might study to prepare themselves for any manner of danger, specialist wizards research schools of magic that make them exceptionally skilled within a specific focus. Yet no matter their specialty, all wizards are masters of the impossible and can aid their allies in overcoming any danger.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d6</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 2d6 &times; 10 gp (average 70 gp.)

He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time by getting 8 hours of sleep and spending 1 hour studying his spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Spells&nbsp;(See Spellbooks below)</strong>: A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from his opposed schools, if any; see Arcane Schools) plus three 1st-level spells of his choice. The wizard also selects a number of additional 1st-level spells equal to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier to add to the spellbook. At each new wizard level, he gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that he can cast (based on his new wizard level) for his spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizardsâ€™ spellbooks to his own (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Spells Gained at a New Level</strong>: Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures. Each time a character attains a new wizard level, he gains two spells of his choice to add to his spellbook. The two free spells must be of spell levels he can cast.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bonus_Languages\"><a name=\"TOC-Bonus-Languages\"></a>Bonus Languages</span></h2>\n<p>A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Arcane_Bond_Ex_or_Sp\">Arcane Bond (Ex or Sp)</span></h2>\n<p>At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;bonded object. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;is a magical pet that enhances the wizardâ€™s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a&nbsp;bonded object&nbsp;is an item a wizard can use to cast additional spells or to serve as a magical item. Once a wizard makes this choice, it is permanent and cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>Rules for bonded items are given below, while rules for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">familiars</a>&nbsp;are located here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar\">Familiars</a>.</p>\n<p>Wizards who select a bonded object begin play with one at no cost. Objects that are the subject of an arcane bond must fall into one of the following categories: amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. These objects are always masterwork quality. Weapons acquired at 1st level are not made of any special material. If the object is an amulet or ring, it must be worn to have effect, while staves, wands, and weapons must be held in one hand. If a wizard attempts to cast a spell without his bonded object worn or in hand, he must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\" rel=\"nofollow\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spellâ€™s level. If the object is a ring or amulet, it occupies the ring or neck slot accordingly.</p>\n<p>A bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that the wizard has in his spellbook and is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wizard, including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wizardâ€™s level. This spell cannot be modified by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from the wizardâ€™s opposition schools (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard#TOC-Arcane-School\">arcane school</a>&nbsp;below).</p>\n<p>A wizard can add additional magic abilities to his bonded object as if he has the required&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats</a>&nbsp;and if he meets the level prerequisites of the feat. For example, a wizard with a bonded dagger must be at least 5th level to add magic abilities to the dagger (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-magic-arms-and-armor-item-creation\">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>&nbsp;feat). If the bonded object is a wand, it loses its wand abilities when its last charge is consumed, but it is not destroyed and it retains all of its bonded object properties and can be used to craft a new wand. The magic properties of a bonded object, including any magic abilities added to the object, only function for the wizard who owns it. If a bonded objectâ€™s owner dies, or the item is replaced, the object reverts to being an ordinary masterwork item of the appropriate type.</p>\n<p>If a bonded object is damaged, it is restored to full hit points the next time the wizard prepares his spells. If the object of an arcane bond is lost or destroyed, it can be replaced after 1 week in a special ritual that costs 200 gp per wizard level plus the cost of the masterwork item. This ritual takes 8 hours to complete. Items replaced in this way do not possess any of the additional enchantments of the previous bonded item. A wizard can designate an existing magic item as his bonded item. This functions in the same way as replacing a lost or destroyed item except that the new magic item retains its abilities while gaining the benefits and drawbacks of becoming a bonded item.</p>\n<h2>Arcane School</h2>\n<p>A wizard can choose to specialize in one school of magic, gaining additional spells and powers based on that school. This choice must be made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. A wizard that does not select a school receives the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;school instead.</p>\n<p>A wizard that chooses to specialize in one school of magic must select two other schools as his opposition schools, representing knowledge sacrificed in one area of arcane lore to gain mastery in another. A wizard who prepares spells from his opposition schools must use two spell slots of that level to prepare the spell. For example, a wizard with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/evocation\">evocation</a>&nbsp;as an opposition school must expend two of his available 3rd-level spell slots to prepare a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fireball\">fireball</a>. In addition, a specialist takes a â€“4 penalty on any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills#TOC-Skill-Checks\" rel=\"nofollow\">skill checks</a>&nbsp;made when crafting a magic item that has a spell from one of his opposition schools as a prerequisite. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;wizard can prepare spells from any school without restriction.</p>\n<p>Each arcane school gives the wizard a number of school powers. In addition, specialist wizards receive an additional spell slot of each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a wizard can prepare a spell from his specialty school in that slot. This spell must be in the wizardâ€™s spellbook. A wizard can select a spell modified by a metamagic feat to prepare in his school slot, but it uses up a higher-level spell slot. Wizards with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/classic-arcane-schools/universalist\">universalist</a>&nbsp;school do not receive a school slot.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Elemental_Arcane_Schools\">Elemental Arcane Schools</span></h2>\n<p>Instead of specializing in a focused arcane school of magic, a wizard can choose to specialize in one of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools\">elemental schools of magic</a>. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental schoolâ€™s spell list. Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/air\">air</a>&nbsp;opposes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/earth\">earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/fire\">fire</a>&nbsp;opposes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-schools/paizo-arcane-schools/elemental-arcane-schools/water\">water</a>). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cantrips\"><a name=\"TOC-Cantrips\"></a>Cantrips</span></h2>\n<p>Wizards can prepare a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Wizard&nbsp;under â€œSpells per Day.â€ These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again. A wizard can prepare a cantrip from an opposition school, but it uses up two of his available slots (see below).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Scribe_Scroll\"><a name=\"TOC-Scribe-Scroll\"></a>Scribe Scroll</span></h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a wizard gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/scribe-scroll-item-creation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scribe Scroll</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Bonus_Feats\"><a name=\"TOC-Bonus-Feats\"></a>Bonus Feats</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, he can choose a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feat</a>, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">item creation</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-mastery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spell Mastery</a>. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feats that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">Item Creation Feats</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">Metamagic Feats</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-mastery\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spell Mastery</a>&nbsp;when choosing those feats.</p>\n<p>A wizard may also choose an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/arcane-discoveries/arcane-discoveries-paizo/\">Arcane Discovery</a>&nbsp;that he qualifies for in place of a bonus feat at these levels.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{"pf1":{"links":{"classAssociations":{"t4CWhLwzTjTrmIaY":1,"8cqRPnTsD26TKZYA":1,"8eM0M6KKplotkDOd":1,"MhlFkfCNxNZ8xXqq":1,"DHbTXXaYa8J1yX9X":1,"sAmRNK15GuVNot0y":1}}}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/beam-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"cIdVd8i711Rf0fo1"}

These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: distance, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/flaming-burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/frost\">frost</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/icy-burst\">icy burst</a>, nimble shot, &nbsp;returning, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock\">shock</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shocking-burst\">shocking burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/speed\">speed</a>.</p>\n<p>Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property&rsquo;s base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.</p>\n<p>A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Weapon Bond (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, an eldritch archer gains a bonded object as per the wizard&rsquo;s arcane bonded object; it must be a ranged weapon, and it can&rsquo;t be used to cast a spell once per day. Holding her bonded item does not prevent the eldritch archer from providing somatic components for her spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Spell Combat (Ex)</strong>: Instead of a light or onehanded melee weapon, an eldritch archer must use a ranged weapon for spell combat. She doesn&rsquo;t need a free hand for ranged spell combat. The eldritch archer cannot accept an attack penalty to gain a bonus on concentration checks to cast a spell defensively. This ability modifies spell combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged Spellstrike (Su):</strong> At 2nd level, whenever an eldritch archer casts a spell that calls for a ranged attack, she can deliver the spell through a ranged weapon she wields as part of a ranged attack. Instead of the free ranged attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, an eldritch archer can make one free ranged attack with a ranged weapon (at her highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. The attack does not increase the spell&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<p>If the spell can normally affect multiple targets, only a single missile, ray, or effect accompanies each attack; if the spell allows multiple attacks and the eldritch archer can make additional ranged attacks as part of a full-round action with spell combat, one additional ray, missile, or effect from the spell accompanies each subsequent ranged attack the eldritch archer makes in the same round until all attacks allowed by the spell are made. Unused missiles, rays, or effects remaining at the end of the eldritch archer&rsquo;s turn are wasted. This ability alters spellstrike.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Focusing Spellstrike (Su):</strong> At 16th level, an eldritch archer can use ranged spellstrike to deliver a cone- or line-shaped spell as a ray, affecting only the creature or object struck. This ability replaces counterstrike.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Magus (Base Class)</strong></p>\n<p>There are those who spend their lives poring over ancient tomes and texts, unlocking the power of magic, and there are those who spend their time perfecting the use of individual weapons, becoming masters without equal. The magus is at once a student of both philosophies, blending magical ability and martial prowess into something entirely unique, a discipline in which both spell and steel are used to devastating effect. As he grows in power, the magus unlocks powerful forms of arcana that allow him to merge his talents further, and at the pinnacle of his art, the magus becomes a blur of steel and magic, a force that few foes would dare to stand against.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Magi spend much of their time traveling the world, learning whatever martial or arcane secrets they can find. They might spend months learning a new sword-fighting style from a master warrior, while simultaneously moonlighting in the local library, poring through tomes of ancient lore. Most who take this path dabble in all sorts of lore, picking up anything that might aid them in their search for perfection.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 4d6 &times; 10 gp (average 140 gp.)

and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>A magus is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. A magus is also proficient with light armor. He can cast magus spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass magus still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>A magus casts arcane spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/magus-spell-list\">magus spell list</a>. A magus must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time.</p>\n<p>To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the magus must have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.

These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5.

These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.</p>\n<p>A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.</p>\n<h2>Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat\">two-weapon fighting</a>, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a â€“2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Casting-Time\">casting time</a>&nbsp;of 1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;(any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>, up to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;bonus, and add the same amount as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. A magus can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.</p>\n<h2>Spellstrike (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of â€œtouchâ€ from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>&nbsp;normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weaponâ€™s critical range (20, 19â€“20, or 18â€“20 and modified by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Keen\">keen</a>&nbsp;weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals Ã—2 damage on a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.</p>\n<h2>Magus Arcana</h2>\n<p>As he gains levels, a magus learns arcane secrets tailored to his specific way of blending martial puissance and magical skill. Starting at 3rd level, a magus gains one magus arcana. He gains an additional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">magus arcana</a>&nbsp;for every three levels of magus attained after 3rd level. Unless specifically noted in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">magus arcanaâ€™s</a>&nbsp;description, a magus cannot select a particular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">magus arcana</a>&nbsp;more than once.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">Magus arcana</a>&nbsp;that affect spells can only be used to modify spells from the magus spell list unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of magus arcana can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/magus-arcana\">Magus Arcana</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spell Recall (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast. With a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spellâ€™s level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Feats</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, and every six levels thereafter, a magus gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">item creation</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>. He must meet the prerequisites for these feats as normal.</p>\n<h2>Knowledge Pool (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, when a magus prepares his magus spells, he can decide to expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool, up to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;bonus. For each point he expends, he can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in his spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If he does not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time he prepares spells, he loses those spells. He can also cast spells added in this way using his spell recall ability, but only until he prepares spells again.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, a magus gains proficiency with medium armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus wearing heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.</p>\n<h2>Improved Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 8th level, the magusâ€™s ability to cast spells and make melee attacks improves. When using the spell combat ability, the magus receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;checks, in addition to any bonus granted by taking an additional penalty on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 10th level, a magus counts 1/2 his total magus level as his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;level for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If he has levels in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>, these levels stack.</p>\n<h2>Improved Spell Recall (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, the magusâ€™s ability to recall spells using his arcane pool becomes more efficient. Whenever he recalls a spell with spell recall, he expends a number of points from his arcane pool equal to 1/2 the spellâ€™s level (minimum 1). Furthermore, instead of recalling a used spell, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;the magus can prepare a spell of the same level that he has in his spellbook. He does so by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spellâ€™s level (minimum 1). The magus cannot apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feats</a>&nbsp;to a spell prepared in this way. The magus does not need to reference his spellbook to prepare a spell in this way.</p>\n<h2>Heavy Armor (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a magus gains proficiency with heavy armor. A magus can cast magus spells while wearing heavy armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, a magus using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component.</p>\n<h2>Greater Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, the magus gains the ability to seamlessly cast spells and make melee attacks. Whenever he uses the spell combat ability, his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check bonus equals double the amount of the attack penalty taken.</p>\n<h2>Counterstrike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, whenever an enemy within reach of the magus successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;from the magus after the spell is complete. This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;cannot disrupt the spell.</p>\n<h2>Greater Spell Access (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, the magus gains access to an expanded spell list. He learns and places 14 spells from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizardâ€™s</a>&nbsp;spell list into his spellbook as magus spells of their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;level. He gains two of each of the following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizard</a>&nbsp;spells not on the magus spell list:</p>\n<p>0-level, 1st-level, 2nd-level, 3rd-level, 4th-level, 5th-level, and 6th-level.</p>\n<p>He can ignore the somatic component of these spells, casting them without the normal chance of spell failure.</p>\n<h2>True Magus (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the magus becomes a master of spells and combat. Whenever he uses his spell combat ability, he does not need to make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;check to cast the spell defensively. Whenever the magus uses spell combat and his spell targets the same creature as his melee attacks, he can choose to either increase the DC to resist the spell by +2, grant himself a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on any checks made to overcome&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>, or grant himself a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus\">circumstance bonus</a>&nbsp;on all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;made against the target during his turn.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"preparation":{"maxAmount":0},"weaponData":{"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{"pf1":{"links":{"classAssociations":{"6CQEHSvVkpph3H3Z":1,"3ur0dJSIFc9hPPtJ":1,"H59nFRWAEBJKbbki":1,"ro3y82E0NH7MSbnh":1,"neNP6FwZayENHAnh":8,"TXGbIGkXUdZ5RrC0":14,"moKgTg0mdMkx6qK0":2,"ct3Zj6i5mR54nZFw":3,"Rd5iSDkRTn8vWRt9":7,"whqIUJSnduJQ2BoU":4,"umTaCDKhBYX1R7mN":5,"qjMpB6HZ3teidnt1":7,"uQqQ5aT16psVpeuG":10,"WWHTlMCogDSHYE7d":11,"6lHbTcdg2emqUS1o":13,"yrnfEu4QxeJkkWqZ":16,"xGaFTKKsWspSqCAi":19,"pKZC5YJN7HQnAbs6":20,"mO85zmzUFigVlRiS":1,"YQW7SOrul7YOtJ7F":8,"qUqC29P5KiKRALDa":14,"RzSERkBYdC028vTc":3,"3UywbY7egLuHei72":7,"rXui5EW0YACLx6Pr":4,"UciZpYYW07BzZi3B":5,"uPoZWaiXu7iSTdum":7,"tI3hTFBm3aHvb6q1":10,"ieJCvOtg52qhetbz":11,"5R4wqkFKGV2lFiJG":13,"QnYOaS7vzH5PINcb":19,"yE991dmAHD3mzHFW":20,"F8ffaDZZRL7E7i90":1,"2GvS4eZK7hD9rWmM":2,"TRNw0tMOYA0DE13t":16}}}},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/spells/enchant-magenta-3.jpg","effects":[],"_id":"f1FMqt3kZu6ICH2S"}

Likewise, the great power wielded by these creatures has long intrigued wizards and alchemists who have sought various magical methods to infuse their bodies with draconic power. As a result, the blood of dragons runs through the veins of many races. For some, this heritage manifests as a sorcerous bloodline and a predilection for magic; for others, however, the power of their draconic ancestors becomes an obsession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities can become dragon disciples, fearsome warriors who possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes. As dragon disciples discover the power of their forebears, they can learn to breathe fire, take flight on leathery wings, and&mdash;at the pinnacle of their abilities&mdash;assume the form of a dragon. Although they are rare, dragon disciples can be found in any land where dragons interact with mortals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Role:</strong> With the magic of a spellcasting class at their disposal, dragon disciples can assume the typical role of a magic-user, hampering the movement of the enemy and hurling damage-dealing spells at their opponents. Dragon disciples&rsquo; draconic abilities, however, make these versatile spellcasters even more formidable, as they use their breath weapons and f light to destroy their foes directly.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alignment: </strong>Dragon disciples can be of any alignment, although they tend to be more chaotic than lawful. Those dragon disciples that assume the traits of chromatic dragons, such as bestial white and fearsome red dragons, have a proclivity for evil. Conversely, those that take after the metallic dragons, such as stoic brass and chivalric gold dragons, are often of good alignments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hit Die:</strong> d12.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Race:</strong> Any nondragon.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Draconic.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells without preparation.
